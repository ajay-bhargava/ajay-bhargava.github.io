The real world we move through (the visual world), and the digital world of the internet, books, data servers, and LLM’s that live stationary at fixed entry points such as laptops, phones, and increasingly on audio interface touch points.</p> <p>Our brains are not designed to unite the vast visual world with the equally vast digital world. As a consequence of this fact, I believe that AR embedded with AI empowered assisted decision support software systems that bridge these two worlds represents the same gain of function for society to the extent ChatGPT empowered humanity to conquer the digital world.</p> <h2 id="what-do-the-brains-biological-limitations-tell-us">What do the brain’s biological limitations tell us?</h2> <p>From the retinal photoreceptors to our occipital lobes, a daisy-chain of hierarchically organized neurons of many kinds achieve 1000:1 compression of our visual world into concise information that can be reasoned with by our brains in real time. The net effect of this is that you never think about 99.9% of what your eyes see because an entire visual executive “assistive” repertoire is “handling it” before the rest of your brain needs to care about it.</p> <p>Reading can, by comparison, feel efficient when content is compressed. Yet, it becomes inefficient as character count you read grows in size. This is because text is symbolic and linear. Yes, syntactically, language is compressed, but requires sequential decoding to make sense of it even when focused solely on reading. This fundamental difference becomes even more clear when what you read earlier has to be paired with live visual input you’re seeing now.</p> <p>Why do we suck at this task? It’s our biology and an evolutionary legacy! Separate neural subsystems are engaged between text (Broca’s, Wernike’s areas) and vision (V1-V4, IT). These systems are operating in parallel. Integration between these two neural subsystems only happens in higher order neural structures such as your prefrontal cortex and that structure is slow and capacity limited. There’s also little pre-computation of text compared to visual information. The hierarchy of daisy-chained visual neurons enables pre-compilation of visual information. There is no such hierarchy for language based information. From a biological standpoint it justifies why tools like GPT that summarize, diagram etc., have taken off in such a dramatic way: these models offload and “assist” the job that your pre-frontal cortex used to spend manual cycles on onto a external digital-organ that pre-processes this for you.</p> <p>You’ve probably unknowingly got an intuition of how humanity has mitigated for our evolutionary bottleneck and why it gives us delight when pre-computation of the visual and digital world is done for you (and makes others money). If you’ve looked at an ad or just about any marketing you’ll know that great marketing is a combination of highly compressed text and visual cues that’s insightful, actionable, and persuasive. Someone has done the visual and textual pre-computation to make the process of making (or swaying) a decision for you trivially easy.</p> <blockquote class="callout callout-important"> <p>Anywhere money is made through rapid perception and low-effort cognition you will find systems that pre-compute visual-text mappings.</p> </blockquote> <p>First, computer vision models parallelized visual computation to beyond the parallelization limit of human abilities. Then, LLM’s became the de-facto extra-corporeal organ for textual pre-computation. What’s next? I think its application of AI that uses multi-modal input prompts that is then in turn used to unlock and gather from the vast digital world by commanding networks of AI agents. Returned information has to be thoughtfully compressed using AI at the interface that people would derive the most delight from being able to act upon this information.</p> <p>Finding the right visual cues to unlock the right access of the relevant digital information in a way thats thoughtful and actionable is the core concept of a decision intelligence SDK and tooling layer that I want to build for the world.</p> <h2 id="what-can-we-learn-from-the-army">What can we learn from the Army?</h2> <h3 id="thank-you-to-our-military-service-members">Thank you to our military-service members</h3> <p>I spent months working intensively on projects with AFC (now TRADOC) when I was at Actuate and that culminated in a test of my work in a life-fire exercise on a base (poorly pictured below - lets just say an M109A7 firing down range will scare the shit out of you). I might look like a total dork here but it was honestly one of the most humbling and informative learning experiences of my life. I am truly humbled by our service-members. Without this there would be no concept of “With Context”.</p> <p><img src="https://with-context-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/internal-memory-documents/2025/07/4ad64a26ce60435fd5fa496797c16bf8.jpg" alt="image" width="100%"/></p> <h3 id="using-well-designed-decision-support-ar-systems">Using well designed decision support AR systems</h3> <p>The U.S. Army and other military branches have decades of R&amp;D into heads-up-display (HUD) systems. You’ve probably seen them mounted on guns, mounted on pilots and lately in autonomous tracking. There are many design philosophies in cognitive ergonomics, information compression, and perceptual prioritization that help enforce I perceive how humans <em>should</em> experience AI that’s embedded in decision support interfaces such as AR glasses.</p> <h4 id="1-cognitive-bandwidth-is-a-ux-constraint">1. Cognitive bandwidth is a UX constraint</h4> <p><em>Too much data ≠ better decisions</em></p> <p>ChatGPT can’t help but spit out just gobs of text. Its insanity. The training runs responsible for aligned AI systems contribute to this problem. So much effort is put into libraries that constrain or structure these generations. The military has a clear doctrine on this:</p> <h4 id="2-data-relevance-beats-quality">2. Data relevance beats quality</h4> <p><em>Offer useful data, don’t offer useless data.</em></p> <p>Intriguingly, early HUD’s were poorly adopted because they dumped raw telemetry (altitude, speed, bearing) at all times in all contexts. Ever sit on an airplane today? Yeah, what good is knowing the distance to your destination when you’re landed at your destination? Or even the ground speed? Pointless.</p> <h4 id="3-intuitive-symbols-leverage-your-visual-cortex">3. Intuitive symbols leverage your visual cortex</h4> <p><em>Sprites and emojis are your friends</em></p> <p>Your mind is adapted to visual context and visual memory! Use it. Taking advantage of standardized symbols (think: Stop Sign, Warning, Road Closed) that are engrained in our visual memory is key to making the decisions actionable.</p> <h4 id="4-make-the-ai-output-aligned-with-the-visual-scene">4. Make the AI output aligned with the visual scene</h4> <p><em>Use vLLM’s to obfuscate prompting/programming</em></p> <p>One of the fastest ways to have HUD be unusable is to have them deliver context that isn’t relevant in that moment, that isn’t ephemeral and is high latency. These were impossible barriers to cross not more than 1 year ago as vLLM’s were still in their infancy. Fortunately, companies like <a href="http://moondream.ai">Moondream</a>are tackling this problem head on. Tiny LLM’s are the rage now, Tiny vLLM’s are the next.</p> <h4 id="5-leverage-attention-to-be-relevant-but-not-annoying">5. Leverage attention to be relevant but not annoying</h4> <p><em>Don’t be annoying</em></p> <p>Ok this one isn’t from the military but brought up from a Bronx native - yes, <a href="https://youtu.be/AWN8VmCTXAU?si=vUBhRzLY2wdDk2M-">Chris Hayes</a>. In an interview with Hasan Minhaj he talks about his book about human attention. Specifically, there are two kinds of attention: voluntary, and compelled. We are subjected to compelled attention mechanisms (e.g. car is honking, should I respond? Phone is buzzing, should I respond?). In things like AR glasses we have to be mindful of the fact that the wearer likely has one other device in his pocket begging for his attention. The Apple Watch has done a better job of being less attention seeking and therefore more relevant (I think). Similarly for UX design we have to think carefully about how the interface is to wield your attention and then unwield it just as fast so as to prevent fatigue, feel ambient, and feel ephemeral. This ephemeral, context driven nature of the equation is also key for a business model here.</p> <h4 id="summary">Summary</h4> <p>A friend and collaborator once told me that wearable AR tech for decision-making should feel like the difference between a good executive assistant (EA) and a bad one. I’ve never had an EA myself, but here’s how I imagine it. If you’re heading up an elevator to a big boardroom meeting, the good EA is prepping you on the way up. They’re making sure the critical context is top of mind right before you walk in. That’s how good military HUD systems work. A solid AR decision support system ensures you’re not just present, but prepared. It makes you capable in ways that go beyond what you could manage alone.</p> <p>The hackathon where we built “EyyyyWear” was our way of pressure-testing this idea. It forced us to build AI agent overlays under real constraints. As developers, we felt those constraints in code. Delivering decision support while humans are in motion is not easy. But that’s where the value shows up. You check if a parking spot is open while your car is still moving. Why? So you can stay nimble in your car, avoid wasting time, and skip a parking ticket all while keeping your hands on the wheel.</p> <p>The hackathon at Betaworks was just an example. The larger point is that these systems are most useful when they meet you in real time, in your flow, in-context. The word “context” really matters here because its a sharp break from the way smartphone apps were designed. Lets get into that next.</p> <h2 id="how-will-ar-powered-with-context-be-more-delightful-to-us-than-smartphones">How will AR powered <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">With Context</code> be more delightful to us than smartphones?</h2> <p>In the era of smartphones: users tap icons, add text, and scroll through apps bought on app stores. Your world is inside the app. In the wearable AR world, I believe that real world is your interface. What appears in your AR glasses while you’re in the real world is driven by the contexts you subscribe to. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Contexts</code> are overlaid AI agents that use images as sophisticated prompts to other models and leverage other AI agents to provision digital datasets to bring meaning to your visual world. I’d love to use this next section to make a case for the fundamental shift between apps and contexts.</p> <h3 id="they-will-provide-context-not-experiences">They will provide <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Context</code>, not “Experiences”</h3> <p>The smartphone app is an “intention-driven” interaction. You buy it, you touch its interface, you let the app decide, you share your experience on it with others. Whether you’re present in our earthly environment or not is beside the point when using an app. You’ve probably seen this when you’re with your friends and they go on their phones. When they’re on the app, they’re <em>in</em> the app. The app is running in their mental foreground, and the developers who created the app have curated the runtime “environment” to keep you engaged. Monetization in the app model is dependent on how much more of the app you want to lock into. Humanity has adapted, and subsequently become fatigued, to the concept and economics of the “app”.</p> <p>In AR, because the visual world is the interface, we’ll be accessing <strong>different</strong> overlay AI agents that own and curate relevant context to your interface at that moment. I call them <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Contexts</code> for short. They wont be something you touch, or intentionally download, they will function specific to visual context. You will be the decision engine, not the app. The net effect of this is: you won’t have to unravel structured visual understanding into low bitrate “words” with your brain, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Contexts</code> will see what you see and do what you normally would’ve done with your phone to aid your decision making. I believe this will be of higher use to society than apps ever were.</p> <p><img src="https://with-context-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/internal-memory-documents/2025/07/8e7e3e3df2f285fb45ede004c3c60428.png" alt="image" width="100%"/></p> <h3 id="monetization-is-ambient-and-quality-reinforcing">Monetization is ambient and quality reinforcing</h3> <p>With smartphone apps, you are paying money detach yourself from the visual world. You then pay even more money for more expensive applications that promise that with AI and AI agents, your time on the app and therefore the length of time you’re detached from the world will shorten.</p> <p>I think the monetization strategy of “eyeball commitment” is one ripe to be flipped on its head. It goes without saying that desktop class applications like “Cluely” which bring decision intelligence as a service to the desktop have scratched a societal itch on this exact business model. To me, this provides validation that we’re touching a very real sore-spot that’s driven by our biology. Cluely’s business model, however, is still very SaaS centric ($20/month) because it lives atop other SaaS applications.</p> <p>I believe we should monetize those AI’s that best function in the digital world where it “sees best”, and shepherd that returned information back to the physical one where we “see” best. Instead of paying to unlock an app, you pay to unlock the right “Contexts” for you.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Apps</th> <th>Contexts</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>App Purchase</td> <td>No fee to download the “Context Platform”</td> </tr> <tr> <td>App Store fees</td> <td>Usage fee for different Contexts</td> </tr> <tr> <td>In-app purchases</td> <td>Higher usage fee for more involved, deeper knowledge parsing or more computationally complex AI agents that require longer reasoning</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <hr/> <h3 id="deliver-actionable-insight-not-just-delight">Deliver actionable insight, not just delight</h3> <p>Most apps don’t leave you with an “actionable” insight, despite leaving you delighted by the UX, UI or a combination of the two. Owing to the constrained interfaces of a heads up display on a pair of glasses, outputs need to be short, punchy, and to the point. Designing for this constraint has to exist at the core cultural level of any “Context” creator. With Context will provide the MCP adaptors, tooling, and even other models in the loop to ensure that the user experience is actionable and purposeful.</p> <h2 id="existing-participants-that-lower-the-barrier">Existing participants that lower the barrier</h2> <h3 id="software-infrastructure">Software Infrastructure</h3> <p>Every AR device manufacturer has some form of a developer SDK that enables device level control of the hardware. <a href="https://github.com/Mentra-Community/MentraOS?tab=readme-ov-file">Mentra OS</a> is no exception here, providing abstraction over multiple devices to enable developers to readily create applications for a suite of AR glasses.</p> <p><img src="https://with-context-public.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/internal-memory-documents/2025/07/50c006594f9e6c81ebe88c5d66fd2a48.png" alt="image" width="100%"/></p> <h4 id="note-about-mentra">Note about Mentra</h4> <p>MentraOS and Mentra Merge are upcoming products alongside Mentra’s glasses. They are also cognizant about AI agents and I believe are well suited to produce the sort of AI overlay context agents I am talking about.</p> <h3 id="vllm-models">vLLM models</h3> <p>There are an increasing number of vLLM makers, most notably <a href="https://moondream.ai">Moondream.ai</a>who are uniquely solving both minification of vLLM’s and also increasing model throughput and inference speed. These represent important bridges between the visual and digital world.</p> <h3 id="digital-ai-agent-makers">Digital AI agent makers</h3> <p>It goes without saying that this venture cannot exist without an ever growing army of AI agents and MCP servers making their way into production grade applications. Even just 1 year ago when some of these AR devices were manufactured and sold for the first time, the concept of AI agents did not exist. Deeper and potentially interesting enterprise grade integrations using digital AI agents will fuel interesting use cases for AR “Contexts”.</p> <h2 id="development-plan">Development Plan</h2> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Level</th> <th>Focus</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">1</td> <td>Validate a Device SDK</td> <td>Despite the fact that there are hardware SDK providers, not all devices are on the same SDK framework (e.g. Typescript).

Unfortunately, the company emphasized Leetcode and I did not pass the coding round because i couldn’t code up a solution to a palindrome substring problem. I wrote this project in the span of 3 days over the weekend. The deployable model and steps to replicate the training of the model are <a href="https://github.com/ajay-bhargava/extrasensory">here</a>.</p> <h1 id="you-can-just-do-things-with-time-series-data">You can just do things with time-series data</h1> <p>It is no secret that I love time-series datastreams and I think humanity should get really good at reading, understanding, leveraging, and making predictions from time-series data.</p> <p>I’ve gleaned some insights while using time-series datasets over the years. Here’s a few:</p> <h2 id="learn-how-to-sleep-better">Learn how to sleep better</h2> <p>When I worked on a project with <a href="https://www.fulcradynamics.com/magazine/are-your-devices-trying-to-tell-you-something-unlocking-personal-health-insights-through-data-with-data-scientist-ajay-bhargava">Fulcra Dynamics</a> I leveraged HealthKit data and other raw data from a continuous glucose monitor. I assembled data at a per second interval and cleansed over 6 months of collection data to produce a multi-modal machine learning approach to find that a patient could get one extra hour of sleep if they just ate their last meal 2-3 hours earlier than they normally did. Intriguingly this is very consistent with the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jürgen_Aschoff">Jürgen Aschoff</a> who found that the body’s circadian rhythm is regulated by multiple cues, including the timing of meals.</p> <p>This dataset was incredibly rich and clean from biased actions because the data was passively collected and required no human intervention. Sure, you could knock the collection accuracy and the precision of the data relative to the human event but that’s an improving trend over time as electronics become more sensitive and the data collection becomes more precise.</p> <h2 id="have-a-job-that-cant-be-stolen-by-ai">Have a job that can’t be stolen by AI</h2> <p>Its no secret that time-series models are incredibly dense matricies.

Consider that for each feature you may have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">np.float</code> at each dimensional position. If you were to place that entire tensor into the context window of a model, you’d very easily overwhelm the model’s window to accept your request. In fact, this is exactly why Google and others developed vision langugage models (vLLM’s) to handle dealing with time-series data in a way that’s more information efficient. I discuss this here:</p> <div class="jekyll-twitter-plugin"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember kids: time-series data analysis with GPT&#39;s isn&#39;t gonna happen with long context windows eating raw time-series, its gonna happen with vLLM&#39;s understanding matplotlib plots: <a href="https://t.co/3F5CxVLZ7y">https://t.co/3F5CxVLZ7y</a></p>&mdash; AJ (@0x1F9ED) <a href="https://twitter.com/0x1F9ED/status/1886227564173111657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div> <h2 id="determine-slip-and-fall-events-from-camera-feeds">Determine slip and fall events from camera feeds</h2> <p>I’ve devised approaches to determine slip and fall events from camera feeds. Security cameras are a pecularity for traditional approaches to detect falling down or slipping. This is because the field of fiew and distance from camera is so variable. You end up getting a dataset of people who are either large, medium or tiny. Not being able to capture the focal points of a human body (e.g. face, shoulders, knees, etc.,) makes it hard to deploy traditional pose-estimation models which means you can’t detect falling down.</p> <p>Furthermore, another caveat with working with security cameras is that in order to emphasize detection speed, it is favorable to use YOLO models. These usually require bounding boxes of people as training data. I had a ton of this data on hand while working at Actuate. As a prototype project, I thought I could use a bounding-box to pixelwise estimation model to grok the instance mask of a person. Then, using this data I further trained up a YOLACT model to track the person’s instance mask over time. Using mask moments I was able to calculate the principle axis of the mask approximated over a time window then train up a LSTM to classify if a person was standing or falling.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/slip-and-fall-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/slip-and-fall-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/slip-and-fall-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/slip-and-fall.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h2 id="learn-why-cancer-grows-the-way-it-does">Learn why cancer grows the way it does</h2> <p>Lots of people today are pilled on either single-cell genomics or spatial transcriptomics. While these are either destructive or non-destructive ways to study cancer cells or cancer tissue <em>in-situ</em> they are not very powerful tools because cancer grows over space, and, crucially, <strong>time</strong>. If people do study cancer cells over time, they’re usually piecing a timeline of events from multiple populations of cancers across different patients and its usually met with mixed results each time.</p> <p>The holy grail is to study the same cancer over time from the initial cell all the way to the final size it grows against (whether that’s when the patient is dead or when the cancer hits a boundary condition). Fortunately, I devised a way to study this (forthcoming blog post). What I can say is that when I did study it this way, I found out <strong>why</strong> cancer tissue grows in a similar pattern every time, even though no two cells are identical.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/clonal-dynamics-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/clonal-dynamics-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/clonal-dynamics-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/clonal-dynamics.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>To create time-series data from imaging data is incredibly challenging and yet incredibly powerful because you can glean how each individual cell behaves within a crowded space over time. By leveraging the right analysis methods for spatiotemporal datasets, you can essentially study matter in the way it actually exists in our world.</p> <h2 id="track-exactly-where-your-package-was-dropped-off">Track <em>exactly</em> where your package was dropped off</h2> <p>Ok, now on to the subject of this post. I’ve been fascinated by the value proposition of <a href="http://www.doorstep.ai">Doorstep.ai</a>. It appears from their website that they are a company that is interested in tracking the last 50ft of the delivery into your building. If you live in a major city and you don’t have a doorman in your building, you know exactly what this pain is.</p> <p>According to a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/685072fe-a21c-8012-97e4-c71c1e82b4bf">ChatGPT</a> driven business estimation via web-search, U.S. carriers absorb roughly $16 billion in write-offs every year when parcels disappear inside buildings or get mis-scanned at the door. A 9-DoF sensor fusion SDK that runs on a driver’s phone to generate a verifiable indoor drop-point coordinate could cut “lost in the last 50 ft” claims by about 30 percent and turning those savings into measurable ROI.</p> <h3 id="doorstepais-sdk-and-data-collection">Doorstep.ai’s SDK and data collection</h3> <p>Intriguingly they have a <a href="https://www.doorstep.ai/docs">SDK</a> that ostensibly runs on the delivery driver’s phone.</p> <div class="language-typescript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">React</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">react</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span>

This section, therefore, talks about the Lets start with the basics of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ExtraSensory</code> dataset.</p> <ol> <li>It is a dataset from 60 users.</li> <li>Participants were asked to install a companion app on their phone.</li> <li>Time sampling was every 20 seconds for every minute.

Thinking about <a href="http://www.doorstep.ai">doorstep.ai</a>’s value proposition of providing precise dropoff location accuracy, I decided to focus on whether or not one could identify whether or not the delivery driver was outdoors or indoors.

    Mark transition windows in the data matrix X for transitions between two mutually exclusive labels.

    This function adds three new boolean columns to X:
        - The first new column is True for samples in a window before each transition.
        - The second new column is True for samples in a window after each transition.
        - The third new column is True at the exact transition point.
    The names for these new columns are provided by new_label_names and appended to label_names.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : np.ndarray
        The input data matrix of shape (n_samples, n_features).
    col_inside : int
        The column index in X corresponding to the </span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">inside</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s"> label (binary: 0 or 1).
    col_outside : int
        The column index in X corresponding to the </span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">outside</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s"> label (binary: 0 or 1).
    window_size : int
        The number of samples before and after the transition to mark as the window.
    label_names : list of str
        The list of existing label/feature names (length should match X.shape[1]).
    new_label_names : list of str
        The list of 3 names for the new columns (e.g., [</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">left_window</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">, </span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">right_window</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">, </span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">transition</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">]).

    Returns
    -------
    X_new : np.ndarray
        The augmented data matrix with three additional boolean columns indicating:
            - Before transition window
            - After transition window
            - At transition point
    label_names_new : list of str
        The updated list of label/feature names with the new column names appended.

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes that the </span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">inside</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s"> and </span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">outside</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s"> columns are mutually exclusive (never both 1).
    - Transitions are detected as changes in the </span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">inside</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s"> label.
    - If a transition window would extend beyond the bounds of X, it is skipped.

This has caveats. The caveats being that you’re beholden to the library’s design choices and support requirements to deploy your model. That being said, there are some pretty robust model libraries out there, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsai</code> is no exception. Training with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsai</code> is easy because it is built ontop of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fastai</code>. Because of this, and recent developements to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TSClassifier</code> class, deploying a model is as simple as running the code below.

</code></pre></div></div> <h2 id="inceptiontimeplus-intuition"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InceptionTimePlus</code> Intuition</h2> <p>I was at UofT doing my Masters in Biochemistry around the same time that Ilya Sutskever was working on the original AlexNet. There is a lot of influence from the original AlexNet in my own understanding of NN architectures and my background and interest in computer vision partly stems from this. I was therefore excited to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InceptionTimePlus</code> as a model architecture for this project. Indeed the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04939">paper</a> does pay quite a bit of homage to the original AlexNet when drawing parallels between the two model architectures.</p> <p>There are many ways to classify time-series data. Most of the approaches are interested in finding features (shapelets, spare-representations, etc.,) that are invariant to the time-index of the time-series.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Nearest Neighbor + NN-DTW: The NN-DTW approach is well described in this <a href="https://medium.com/walmartglobaltech/time-series-similarity-using-dynamic-time-warping-explained-9d09119e48ec">blog</a> post.</p> </li> <li> <p>BOSS: Breaks the time-series into symbolic features via discrete fourier transform. Then discretizes the features into bins, and if I’m getting this right, measures the euclidean distance between the features.</p> </li> </ol> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">InceptionTime</code> works in a similar way as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AlexNet</code>. You have a sliding window of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> filters on the multivariate time-series. In the case of my dataset its 225 features over 5 minutes. What this does is that it reduces the dimensionality of the time-series from 225 features to the number of filters. This “bottlenecking” reduces the multi-variate features of the feature space (that’s accelerometer, gyroscope etc.,) to a set of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> filters.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/InceptionTime-Architecture-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/InceptionTime-Architecture-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/InceptionTime-Architecture-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/InceptionTime-Architecture.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>You can think of this the same way as a multi-dimensional image. If you’ve ever worked in science and have used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.czi</code> format from Zeiss you know that a typical fluorescence image can be a 4-30 dimensional image based on the number of channels collected at various filter-band passes or excitations based on your laser. Time series works the same way in the multi-variate space. The time dimension is only collapsed in the very last layer. What happens there is just some pooling of the time-series against the collapsed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> features from the sliding window over the time-series. This is also why making sure you choose a temporal window that’s cleanly defined is so important.</p> <p>There are obviously different are more interesting filters one could conjure up for time-series data but this method is a good starting point and a good model architecture.</p> <h2 id="weights-and-biases-callbacks">Weights and Biases Callbacks</h2> <p>You’re probably wondering what is this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WandbCallback</code>? Its a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fastai</code> callback that logs the training and validation metrics to <a href="https://wandb.ai/site">Weights and Biases</a>.

I thought it was weird that the pickled model required the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wandb</code> library. This might’ve been due to the fact that one of the model callbacks was a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wandb</code> callback.</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">wandb</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mode</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">disabled</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <h2 id="sparsity-of-the-dataset">Sparsity of the dataset</h2> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Extrasensory</code> dataset was sampled at a rate of 1 minute. Events such as walking between inside and outside happen at a much faster frequency than 1 minute. This means that the model and its ability to generalize for indoor versus outdoor classification might be limited. Ideally you’d want a sampling frequency of at least once per second or even faster. This would pose challenges from a battery life perspective and potentially pose challenges if the data was uploaded to the cloud when the phone is in wifi range.</p> <h1 id="gushing-over-modal">Gushing over Modal</h1> <p>Its no secret that I gush over Modal.

It wasn’t just bad luck or inexperience. It was mindset. A mindset rooted in scarcity, distrust, and control.</p> <p>I hated handing off experiments. No one else could possibly “see” what I saw or do it “right.” I believed that if I didn’t do the science myself, it wasn’t real. And so, I spun my wheels, designing experiments that were fundamentally flawed because the question itself was bad. I was, frankly, full of shit.</p> <p>A few years later, after a humbling and productive stint at a biotech startup in NYC, I started my PhD at the Francis Crick Institute in London. It was there that everything shifted.</p> <p>I learned that the “hand of crap” isn’t a curse it’s a consequence of weak ideas. Strong hypotheses yield informative outcomes, regardless of which way the data goes. Great scientists design experiments where every outcome tells you something valuable. And more importantly, they choose problems that require minimal manipulation of nature.</p> <p>This was liberating.</p> <p>Suddenly, I wasn’t worried about breaking the system. The biology just was. Whether I’d just flown back from Paris or finished a gym session, the phenomena were robust and reproducible.</p> <blockquote> <p>I’m writing up a manuscript on how the rulebook of spatiotemporal tumor heterogeneity is underwritten by Newtonian physics.</p> </blockquote> <p>This confidence had a compounding effect. I started trusting the Crick’s core facilities—plasmid sequencing, FACS, histopathology, microscopy, even mouse husbandry. I wasn’t relying on other postdocs or grad students to scale my work. I was leveraging world-class infrastructure to move faster. My role was to think deeply, coordinate precisely, and execute smartly.</p> <p>As the projects grew, so did the quality of my collaborators. They weren’t generalists. They were niche technology experts—people who had built custom tools that could be integrated into my workflow. It was no accident. The Crick was built for this kind of velocity. Their Scientific Technology Platforms (STPs) were low on bureaucracy and high on readiness. Execution was just… fast.</p> <p>Having come from industry, I saw what many didn’t: the Crick was structured like a biotech company. The core facilities weren’t just helpful, they were essential to increasing DBTL (Design, Build, Test, Learn) cycles. Scientists who understood this system who knew how to orchestrate across this distributed network were winning. Fast.</p> <p>And if you don’t believe me, just look at the publication record.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="science-posts"/><category term="science"/><category term="research"/><category term="mindset"/><category term="execution"/><category term="dbtl"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reflections on mindset, infrastructure, and scientific velocity—from the Crick to startup biotech.]]></summary></entry></feed>
