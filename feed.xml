Here’s a few:</p> <h2 id="learn-how-to-sleep-better">Learn how to sleep better</h2> <p>When I worked on a project with <a href="https://www.fulcradynamics.com/magazine/are-your-devices-trying-to-tell-you-something-unlocking-personal-health-insights-through-data-with-data-scientist-ajay-bhargava">Fulcra Dynamics</a> I leveraged HealthKit data and other raw data from a continuous glucose monitor. I assembled data at a per second interval and cleansed over 6 months of collection data to produce a multi-modal machine learning approach to find that a patient could get one extra hour of sleep if they just ate their last meal 2-3 hours earlier than they normally did. Intriguingly this is very consistent with the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jürgen_Aschoff">Jürgen Aschoff</a> who found that the body’s circadian rhythm is regulated by multiple cues, including the timing of meals.</p> <p>This dataset was incredibly rich and clean from biased actions because the data was passively collected and required no human intervention. Sure, you could knock the collection accuracy and the precision of the data relative to the human event but that’s an improving trend over time as electronics become more sensitive and the data collection becomes more precise.</p> <h2 id="have-a-job-that-cant-be-stolen-by-ai">Have a job that can’t be stolen by AI</h2> <p>Its no secret that time-series models are incredibly dense matricies. In a typical time-series tensor you’ve got three dimensions:</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Where the first dimension is the sample you’re looking at and the second and third dimension could be the number of time-stamps collected and the number of features collected at each time-stamp. Consider that for each feature you may have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">np.float</code> at each dimensional position. If you were to place that entire tensor into the context window of a model, you’d very easily overwhelm the model’s window to accept your request. In fact, this is exactly why Google and others developed vision langugage models (vLLM’s) to handle dealing with time-series data in a way that’s more information efficient. I discuss this here:</p> <div class="jekyll-twitter-plugin"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember kids: time-series data analysis with GPT&#39;s isn&#39;t gonna happen with long context windows eating raw time-series, its gonna happen with vLLM&#39;s understanding matplotlib plots: <a href="https://t.co/3F5CxVLZ7y">https://t.co/3F5CxVLZ7y</a></p>&mdash; AJ (@0x1F9ED) <a href="https://twitter.com/0x1F9ED/status/1886227564173111657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div> <h2 id="learn-why-cancer-grows-the-way-it-does">Learn why cancer grows the way it does</h2> <p>Lots of people today are pilled on either single-cell genomics or spatial transcriptomics. While these are either destructive or non-destructive ways to study cancer cells or cancer tissue <em>in-situ</em> they are not very powerful tools because cancer grows over space, and, crucially, <strong>time</strong>. If people do study cancer cells over time, they’re usually piecing a timeline of events from multiple populations of cancers across different patients and its usually met with mixed results each time.</p> <p>The holy grail is to study the same cancer over time from the initial cell all the way to the final size it grows against (whether that’s when the patient is dead or when the cancer hits a boundary condition). Fortunately, I devised a way to study this (forthcoming blog post). What I can say is that when I did study it this way, I found out <strong>why</strong> cancer tissue grows in a similar pattern every time, even though no two cells are identical.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/clonal-dynamics-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/clonal-dynamics-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/clonal-dynamics-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/clonal-dynamics.png" class="img-fluid" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>To create time-series data from imaging data is incredibly challenging and yet incredibly powerful because you can glean how each individual cell behaves within a crowded space over time. By leveraging the right analysis methods for spatiotemporal datasets, you can essentially study matter in the way it actually exists in our world.</p> <h2 id="track-exactly-where-your-package-was-dropped-off">Track <em>exactly</em> where your package was dropped off</h2> <p>Ok, now on to the subject of this post. I’ve been fascinated by the value proposition of <a href="http://www.doorstep.ai">Doorstep.ai</a>. It appears from their website that they are a company that is interested in tracking the last 50ft of the delivery into your building. If you live in a major city and you don’t have a doorman in your building, you know exactly what this pain is.</p> <p>According to a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/685072fe-a21c-8012-97e4-c71c1e82b4bf">ChatGPT</a> driven business estimation via web-search, U.S. carriers absorb roughly $16 billion in write-offs every year when parcels disappear inside buildings or get mis-scanned at the door. A 9-DoF sensor fusion SDK that runs on a driver’s phone to generate a verifiable indoor drop-point coordinate could cut “lost in the last 50 ft” claims by about 30 percent and turning those savings into measurable ROI.</p> <h3 id="doorstepais-sdk-and-data-collection">Doorstep.ai’s SDK and data collection</h3> <p>Intriguingly they have a <a href="https://www.doorstep.ai/docs">SDK</a> that ostensibly runs on the delivery driver’s phone.</p> <div class="language-typescript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">React</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">react</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span>

Implementing this in python required a bit of work but ultimately resulted in the desired effect, I had more temporal windows to work with that narrowly described the transition between the outside and inside class within a specified window of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">window_size</code>.</p> <h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mark_transition_windows</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">col_inside</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">col_outside</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">window_size</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">label_names</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">new_label_names</span><span class="p">):</span>

    Mark transition windows in the data matrix X for transitions between two mutually exclusive labels.

    This function adds three new boolean columns to X:
        - The first new column is True for samples in a window before each transition.
        - The second new column is True for samples in a window after each transition.
        - The third new column is True at the exact transition point.
    The names for these new columns are provided by new_label_names and appended to label_names.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : np.ndarray
        The input data matrix of shape (n_samples, n_features).
    col_inside : int
        The column index in X corresponding to the </span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">inside</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s"> label (binary: 0 or 1).
    col_outside : int
        The column index in X corresponding to the </span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">outside</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s"> label (binary: 0 or 1).
    window_size : int
        The number of samples before and after the transition to mark as the window.
    label_names : list of str
        The list of existing label/feature names (length should match X.shape[1]).
    new_label_names : list of str
        The list of 3 names for the new columns (e.g., [</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">left_window</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">, </span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">right_window</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">, </span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">transition</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">]).

    Returns
    -------
    X_new : np.ndarray
        The augmented data matrix with three additional boolean columns indicating:
            - Before transition window
            - After transition window
            - At transition point
    label_names_new : list of str
        The updated list of label/feature names with the new column names appended.

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes that the </span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">inside</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s"> and </span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">outside</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s"> columns are mutually exclusive (never both 1).
    - Transitions are detected as changes in the </span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">inside</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="s"> label.
    - If a transition window would extend beyond the bounds of X, it is skipped.

It wasn’t just bad luck or inexperience. It was mindset. A mindset rooted in scarcity, distrust, and control.</p> <p>I hated handing off experiments. No one else could possibly “see” what I saw or do it “right.” I believed that if I didn’t do the science myself, it wasn’t real. And so, I spun my wheels, designing experiments that were fundamentally flawed because the question itself was bad. I was, frankly, full of shit.</p> <p>A few years later, after a humbling and productive stint at a biotech startup in NYC, I started my PhD at the Francis Crick Institute in London. It was there that everything shifted.</p> <p>I learned that the “hand of crap” isn’t a curse it’s a consequence of weak ideas. Strong hypotheses yield informative outcomes, regardless of which way the data goes. Great scientists design experiments where every outcome tells you something valuable. And more importantly, they choose problems that require minimal manipulation of nature.</p> <p>This was liberating.</p> <p>Suddenly, I wasn’t worried about breaking the system. The biology just was. Whether I’d just flown back from Paris or finished a gym session, the phenomena were robust and reproducible.</p> <blockquote> <p>I’m writing up a manuscript on how the rulebook of spatiotemporal tumor heterogeneity is underwritten by Newtonian physics.</p> </blockquote> <p>This confidence had a compounding effect. I started trusting the Crick’s core facilities—plasmid sequencing, FACS, histopathology, microscopy, even mouse husbandry. I wasn’t relying on other postdocs or grad students to scale my work. I was leveraging world-class infrastructure to move faster. My role was to think deeply, coordinate precisely, and execute smartly.</p> <p>As the projects grew, so did the quality of my collaborators. They weren’t generalists. They were niche technology experts—people who had built custom tools that could be integrated into my workflow. It was no accident. The Crick was built for this kind of velocity. Their Scientific Technology Platforms (STPs) were low on bureaucracy and high on readiness. Execution was just… fast.</p> <p>Having come from industry, I saw what many didn’t: the Crick was structured like a biotech company. The core facilities weren’t just helpful, they were essential to increasing DBTL (Design, Build, Test, Learn) cycles. Scientists who understood this system who knew how to orchestrate across this distributed network were winning. Fast.</p> <p>And if you don’t believe me, just look at the publication record.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="science-posts"/><category term="science"/><category term="research"/><category term="mindset"/><category term="execution"/><category term="dbtl"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reflections on mindset, infrastructure, and scientific velocity—from the Crick to startup biotech.]]></summary></entry></feed>
