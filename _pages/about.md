You want to work with me because I'm a rare scientist-engineer hybrid who consistently delivers exceptional results across diverse roles in diverse industries.

After excelling as a bench biochemist and systems biologist, I earned my [Ph.D. with Erik Sahai](https://www.crick.ac.uk/), where I pioneered ML/AI applications to decode spatiotemporal clonal dynamics through multimodal imaging and computer vision.

My career highlights:

1. Built ML tools at [GSK](http://gsk.ai) & [Regeneron](http://www.regeneron.com) for healthcare imaging analysis
2. Deployed real-time threat detection AI to 20K+ cameras at [Actuate](http://actuate.ai)
3. Architected platforms handling 100s of TB of scientific data at [TetraScience](https://www.tetrascience.com/)
4. Founded [Bynd.Bio](https://www.bynd.bio) to revolutionize lab experiment execution with REST APIs

> I want to build useful, delightful AI products at the intersection of computer vision, software engineering, and biotechnology.
